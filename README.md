creating code templates, practicing good document design, setting up environments for coding, and practicing good coding practices.

--------------
# Project 2:

Individual project in which we create an alarm/timer system using the Nucleo embedded platform.
Includes uses of LEDs, external keypad, and an LCD display.

--------------
# Project 3:
--------------
Indivudual project designed entirely on my own.

Includes uses of LEDs, Servo Motor, Ultrasonic Sensor, Nucleo, Jumper Wires, and Solderless Breadboard

Project works within the area of autonomous devices, where my device is a hands-free self-dumping trash can in which users place their trash on the top of the can and wave their hand in front of a sensor to dump their trash inside. This saves the user from having to touch any part of the trash can and keeps it as a closed lid can by having a cover on the top that only moves to dump trash.
